**overlayfs** is a composite filesystem (currently only) for [Afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero) with similar but different semantics compared to Afero's [copyOnWriteFs](https://github.com/spf13/afero/blob/master/copyOnWriteFs.go). See the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/bep/overlayfs) for more information.
